Add lists of things to do and/or ideas here to keep organized.

	- Side-thought, but I believe I saw that require(../) was removed in a newer version of Node.  We should go ahead and accommodate this now rather than having it break when that version becomes stable.

	- Come up with plugin architecture and define what's to be the core.

	- Modify build script to enforce ordering (platform independent). Needs to be more robust anyway.  Look at Jquery Makefile for ideas.

	- Need to change places where we assume coffeescript is installed globally with NPM to having it use the node_modules version installed with 'npm install -d'.

	- Look over flags for uglify-js, see if we can find some more useful ones.  Obfuscate perhaps?
