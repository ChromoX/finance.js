Add lists of things to do and/or ideas here to keep organized.


Thought 10/10:
	- Create Calculation class/object.  Have it automatically spawn and manage web workers for
		the sake of computational distribution.  Then, most calculations we would like to perform 
		(ex: DI+, DI-, RSI, etc.. in the case of stocks) inherits from calculation.

		ex:		var Calculation = require('calulation.js');
				var RSI = new Calculation.RSI(data);
				RSI.calculate(period);
				var DI = new Calculation.DI(data);
				DI.calculate(period);
