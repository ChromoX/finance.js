Add lists of things to do and/or ideas here to keep organized.

	-Need to change places where we assume coffeescript is installed globally with NPM to having it use the node_modules version installed with 'npm install -d'.

	- Look over flags for uglify-js, see if we can find some more useful ones.  Obfuscate perhaps?

	- While I'm thinking about it, Jeffrey: PLEASE modify your word-wrap to be shorter.  I typically have a given Vim window that spans half of my screen (all of which are 1920x1080), because either I have 1/2 browser + 1/2 Vim or two split-pane Vim's that are 1/2 each.  But a lot of the files you've written (notably the Cakefile) wrap to the point that it's illegible because I can't reasonably parse indentation with my eyes.
